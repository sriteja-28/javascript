<!-- 
In JavaScript, let, var, and const are used to declare variables, 
but they differ in scope, hoisting behavior, and mutability. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of each:

1. var
Scope: var is function-scoped, meaning it is only accessible within the 
function where it's declared. If declared outside of a function, it's globally scoped.
Hoisting: Variables declared with var are hoisted to the top of their scope. 
This means you can use the variable before its declaration, though it will be undefined
 until the line where it's actually assigned.
Re-declaration: You can re-declare the same variable multiple times within the same 
scope without causing an error.
Example:

javascript
Copy code
function example() {
  console.log(x); // undefined due to hoisting
  var x = 10;
  console.log(x); // 10
}
2. let
Scope: let is block-scoped, meaning it is only accessible within the block {} where it's declared. 
This includes loops, if statements, and functions.
Hoisting: Variables declared with let are hoisted, but they are not initialized. 
They are in a "temporal dead zone" from the start of the block until the declaration is encountered,
 so using the variable before declaration causes a ReferenceError.
Re-declaration: You cannot re-declare the same variable within the same block scope.
Example:

javascript
Copy code
function example() {
  console.log(x); // ReferenceError
  let x = 10;
  console.log(x); // 10
}
3. const
Scope: Like let, const is also block-scoped.
Hoisting: const is hoisted, but like let, it is also in the "temporal dead zone" until its 
declaration is encountered.
Re-declaration: You cannot re-declare a const variable within the same scope.
Mutability: Variables declared with const cannot be reassigned after they are initialized. 
However, if the const variable is an object or array, the contents (properties or elements) can still be modified.
Example:

javascript
Copy code
function example() {
  const x = 10;
  console.log(x); // 10
  x = 20; // TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.
}

const arr = [1, 2, 3];
arr.push(4); // Allowed
arr = [5, 6, 7]; // TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.

When to Use:
var: Generally, it's better to avoid using var in modern JavaScript because it can lead to
 unexpected behavior due to its function-scoped nature and hoisting.
let: Use let when you need a variable that can be reassigned and is block-scoped. 
It's the most common choice for general-purpose variables.
const: Use const for variables that should not be reassigned, especially for constants or objects
 that should not be reassigned, though their properties can still be changed.
In summary, prefer let and const for most of your variable declarations, with const being
 the default choice unless you know you need to reassign the variable. -->
