Inheritance in JavaScript allows one class to inherit properties and methods from another class, enabling code reuse and the creation of more complex and specialized classes. In JavaScript, inheritance can be achieved using the extends keyword when working with ES6 classes or by setting up prototypes in ES5.

Inheritance with ES6 Classes
Here’s an example of how inheritance works with ES6 classes:

javascript
Copy code
// Base class (Parent class)
class Person {
    constructor(name, age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }

    greet() {
        return `Hello, my name is ${this.name}.`;
    }
}

// Derived class (Child class)
class Student extends Person {
    constructor(name, age, studentId, marks) {
        // Call the parent class constructor with super
        super(name, age);
        this.studentId = studentId;
        this.marks = marks;
    }

    study() {
        return `${this.name} is studying.`;
    }

    get totalMarks() {
        return this.marks.reduce((acc, mark) => acc + mark, 0);
    }
}

// Creating an instance of the Student class
let student = new Student("Teja", 22, "S12345", [85, 90, 78]);

console.log(student.greet()); // Inherited from Person: "Hello, my name is Teja."
console.log(student.study()); // Specific to Student: "Teja is studying."
console.log(student.totalMarks); // Specific to Student: 253
console.log(student.age); // Inherited property from Person: 22
Key Points:
extends Keyword: The Student class extends the Person class, meaning it inherits all the properties and methods of Person.
super() Function: Inside the Student constructor, super(name, age) calls the constructor of the Person class, ensuring that the name and age properties are set up correctly.
Inherited Methods and Properties: Student inherits methods like greet and properties like name and age from Person.
New Methods and Properties: Student also has its own properties (studentId, marks) and methods (study, totalMarks).
Inheritance with ES5 (Prototypes)
Before ES6, inheritance in JavaScript was handled through prototypes:

javascript
Copy code
// Base constructor function
function Person(name, age) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
}

Person.prototype.greet = function() {
    return `Hello, my name is ${this.name}.`;
};

// Derived constructor function
function Student(name, age, studentId, marks) {
    Person.call(this, name, age); // Inherit properties
    this.studentId = studentId;
    this.marks = marks;
}

// Inherit methods from Person
Student.prototype = Object.create(Person.prototype);

// Ensure the constructor is set correctly
Student.prototype.constructor = Student;

Student.prototype.study = function() {
    return `${this.name} is studying.`;
};

Student.prototype.totalMarks = function() {
    return this.marks.reduce((acc, mark) => acc + mark, 0);
};

// Creating an instance of the Student
var student = new Student("Teja", 22, "S12345", [85, 90, 78]);

console.log(student.greet()); // Inherited from Person: "Hello, my name is Teja."
console.log(student.study()); // Specific to Student: "Teja is studying."
console.log(student.totalMarks()); // Specific to Student: 253
console.log(student.age); // Inherited property from Person: 22
Key Points for ES5:
Constructor Functions: Person and Student are defined as constructor functions.
call Method: Person.call(this, name, age) is used to inherit properties from the Person function.
Prototypal Inheritance: Student.prototype = Object.create(Person.prototype) is used to inherit methods from Person.
Constructor Property: Student.prototype.constructor = Student; ensures that the constructor property points back to Student.
Conclusion
In ES6, inheritance is more straightforward and resembles classical inheritance in other object-oriented languages. In ES5, inheritance requires manual setup using prototypes. Both approaches are valid in JavaScript, but ES6 provides a more modern and cleaner syntax for working with classes and inheritance.

In object-oriented programming, inheritance allows a class (child or subclass) to inherit properties and methods from another class (parent or superclass). While JavaScript primarily supports single inheritance, other programming languages support multiple forms of inheritance. Here’s an overview of the different types of inheritance:

1. Single Inheritance
Definition: A class inherits from only one parent class.
Example: This is the most common type of inheritance in JavaScript.
Example in JavaScript:
javascript
Copy code
class Animal {
    constructor(name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
    speak() {
        console.log(`${this.name} makes a sound.`);
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    speak() {
        console.log(`${this.name} barks.`);
    }
}

let dog = new Dog("Buddy");
dog.speak(); // Output: Buddy barks.
2. Multiple Inheritance
Definition: A class inherits from more than one parent class.
Example: JavaScript does not natively support multiple inheritance directly, but it can be simulated using mixins (a way to include multiple behaviors).
Example in JavaScript:
javascript
Copy code
// Mixin example to simulate multiple inheritance
let canFly = {
    fly() {
        console.log(`${this.name} is flying.`);
    }
};

let canSwim = {
    swim() {
        console.log(`${this.name} is swimming.`);
    }
};

class Animal {
    constructor(name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
}

class Duck extends Animal {
    constructor(name) {
        super(name);
    }
}

Object.assign(Duck.prototype, canFly, canSwim);

let duck = new Duck("Donald");
duck.fly(); // Output: Donald is flying.
duck.swim(); // Output: Donald is swimming.
3. Multilevel Inheritance
Definition: A class is derived from a class that is also derived from another class, forming a chain of inheritance.
Example in JavaScript:
javascript
Copy code
class Animal {
    constructor(name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
    speak() {
        console.log(`${this.name} makes a sound.`);
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    speak() {
        console.log(`${this.name} barks.`);
    }
}

class Bulldog extends Dog {
    speak() {
        console.log(`${this.name} growls.`);
    }
}

let bulldog = new Bulldog("Rocky");
bulldog.speak(); // Output: Rocky growls.
4. Hierarchical Inheritance
Definition: Multiple classes inherit from a single parent class.
Example in JavaScript:
javascript
Copy code
class Animal {
    constructor(name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
    speak() {
        console.log(`${this.name} makes a sound.`);
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    speak() {
        console.log(`${this.name} barks.`);
    }
}

class Cat extends Animal {
    speak() {
        console.log(`${this.name} meows.`);
    }
}

let dog = new Dog("Buddy");
let cat = new Cat("Whiskers");

dog.speak(); // Output: Buddy barks.
cat.speak(); // Output: Whiskers meows.
5. Hybrid Inheritance
Definition: A combination of two or more types of inheritance (e.g., single and multiple inheritance). JavaScript can simulate hybrid inheritance using a mix of techniques like classes, prototypes, and mixins.
Example in JavaScript:
javascript
Copy code
// Mixin example
let canFly = {
    fly() {
        console.log(`${this.name} is flying.`);
    }
};

class Animal {
    constructor(name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
    speak() {
        console.log(`${this.name} makes a sound.`);
    }
}

class Bird extends Animal {
    constructor(name) {
        super(name);
    }
}

Object.assign(Bird.prototype, canFly);

class Dog extends Animal {
    speak() {
        console.log(`${this.name} barks.`);
    }
}

let bird = new Bird("Tweety");
bird.fly(); // Output: Tweety is flying.

let dog = new Dog("Buddy");
dog.speak(); // Output: Buddy barks.
Summary:
Single Inheritance: One child, one parent.
Multiple Inheritance: One child, multiple parents (simulated in JavaScript with mixins).
Multilevel Inheritance: A chain of inheritance.
Hierarchical Inheritance: Multiple children, one parent.
Hybrid Inheritance: A combination of different inheritance types (can be simulated in JavaScript).
JavaScript primarily uses single inheritance but can simulate more complex forms using techniques like prototypes and mixins.
